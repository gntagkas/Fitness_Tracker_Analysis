### Goal of the Junior Data Analyst

As a junior data analyst on Bellabeat's marketing team, my goal is to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device usage data to better understand how customers are already using their smart devices.

Based on our findings, I will provide recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### Key Questions:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### 2. Data Sources

We used FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (available through Mobius). This data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty FitBit Users.

The data set provides the following informations about users:

- Heart rate
- Calories
- Intensity
- Steps
- Sleep
- Mets
- Physical Activity (minutes and category).
- Weight, Fat, BMI.

The data are quite old, almost 10 years ago, so their accuracy may be affected by changes in user behavior over time. 

While the dataset contains valuable information about users, the sample size is relatively small, expanding it would improve the reliability of the analysis.

Furthermore having access to other factors, such as gender or age group, would allow for deeper and more targeted insights.

Despite these limitations, the dataset still allows us to identify trends and propose useful ideas and directions to BellaBeat stakeholders.
